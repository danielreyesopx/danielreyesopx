n8n Automation Portfolio

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

This repository documents my learning and hands-on experience building automation workflows using **n8n**, **JavaScript**, and API integrations.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate real-world automation skills aligned with **Junior Automation ** roles, including workflow design, API integrations, error handling, QA testing, logging, and documentation.

This is a **living repository** that evolves as my skills improve.
