# First n8n Workflow – Learning Phase

## Goal
Create my first structured n8n workflow following production-style thinking.

## Planned Functionality
- Trigger: Webhook
- Validate incoming JSON payload
- Log payload data
- Handle basic errors

## Current Status
Planned / In progress

## Notes
This workflow will evolve as I learn:
- Routing and branching
- Error handling
- QA testing
- Logging and retries
